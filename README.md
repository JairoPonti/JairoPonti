I am a Full Stack Web Developer with experience in Ecommerce. My most recent work was at Valtech, where I was part of a team dedicated to the Arcor brand. I was responsible for developing and maintaining custom applications for their website "Tokin Tienda."

I strongly value effective communication in any work environment and consider it essential among developers, QA, and all team members.
